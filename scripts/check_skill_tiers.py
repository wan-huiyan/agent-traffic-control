"""Hold the skill listing inside its budget, by policy rather than by luck.

WHY THIS EXISTS
    `check_skill_descriptions.py` (vendored, do not edit) measures the listing and
    tells you when it is over. It does not stop the next skill from putting it over.
    v1.18.0 cut the listing from 23,174 chars to 7,542 against an 8,000-char HARD
    CEILING. Without a gate that is a state the repo drifts out of silently -- and the
    failure is invisible: descriptions get collapsed to bare names, everything still
    "works", and the model just stops being able to see what a skill is for.

    HOW MUCH ROOM IS LEFT, exactly. The default profile's target is 7,780, which is 238
    chars above today's 7,542 and 220 below the hard ceiling. Say what 238 buys, because
    "room to grow" on its own is how a gate ends up refusing the first real addition:

      one more NAME-LED skill fits.  An entry costs len(name) + 4 + len(description) + 1
      separator, so a name-led entry at its 160-char ceiling costs len(name) + 165 --
      177 to 237 across this repo's name lengths (12 to 72 chars). 238 was chosen to
      cover the LONGEST of those, so one fits whatever it is called, and a second does
      not fit at any name length.

      nothing else fits.  A short entry costs up to 357 and a rich one up to 677 at the
      longest name here. Adding either -- or a second name-led -- means SHORTENING
      something in the same pull request, which is the decision this gate exists to force.

    The 220-char strip between the target and the hard ceiling is the warning band: over
    target is a red build you can fix at leisure, over 8,000 is the harness silently
    dropping descriptions. Do not raise the target to 8,000 to make a build pass.

    So every live skill declares a SIZE CLASS, each class has a headcount cap and a
    length ceiling, and promoting a skill means naming the one it displaces.

THE CLASSES, and why size is decided this way
    The listing budget is global -- roughly a hundred model-invocable skills from
    every installed plugin compete for it -- and the harness fills it by usage rank
    first, then array position. So:

      rich      a skill with a `skillUsage` record is admitted regardless of size and
                its description is certain to be READ. Spend characters there.
      short     zero usage, and the name does not say when to reach for it. The
                description is invisible today; its length only decides whether it can
                ever fit leftover slack. Keep it small, make it a classifier.
      name-led  zero usage, but the name already states the moment. One sentence.

    Measured on 2026-08-07, on this machine's installed copy: of 20 entries, exactly 7
    carried a description, and those 7 were exactly the 7 with a usage record.

WHAT IT CHECKS  (exit 1 on any)
    1. every live skill declares `listing_tier: rich|short|name-led`, and no
       reference-only skill declares one.
    2. headcount caps per class, and on the total.
    3. per-class description ceilings.
    4. the listing total, recomputed with the vendored gate's own formula.
    5. every reference-only skill is reachable from a LIVE skill's body.
    6. no cross-link or provenance boilerplate inside a description.
    7. every SKILL.md has a frontmatter that PARSES -- a closing `---` on its own
       line. This one is not a style rule. `_split_frontmatter` returns None without
       it, `parse_skill` returns None, and the vendored gate then drops the skill from
       its own census: a missing delimiter took the header from
       `98 SKILL.md (20 model-invocable)` to `97 SKILL.md (19 model-invocable)` and
       still exited 0. Nothing reports it. Verified by breaking one file on purpose.
