  When dispatching a code-review / verification / research subagent that has LIVE database or cloud
  access (BigQuery, gcloud, psql, Bash), give it an EXPLICIT tool-call + wall-time budget and tell it
  which expensive probes NOT to re-run — otherwise it re-verifies everything from scratch, runs 20-40+
  minutes, and can hit a transport "socket connection was closed unexpectedly" error that returns NO
  final message (its entire investigation output is LOST and it is NOT resumable unless a continue/
  SendMessage tool exists). Use when: (1) you're about to dispatch a `general-purpose` agent to review
  a PR / verify findings with live-DB or gcloud access; (2) an Agent call returned `API Error: The
  socket connection was closed unexpectedly` with `tool_uses: N` (>0) but `subagent_tokens: 0` / no
  verdict — its work happened but the result was never delivered; (3) a review agent has been running
  >20-30 min with no return; (4) you already validated the heavy probes yourself and just want a static
  diff review + the fast test. Fix: bound the prompt ("≤8 tool calls, target <6 min, do NOT run BQ
  probes — I already verified X/Y/Z; review the diff statically + run only the fast unit test") and
  prefer several short bounded reviewers over one open-ended one. See also

# A review subagent with live-DB access needs an explicit probe budget

## Problem

You dispatch a `general-purpose` subagent to review a PR or verify findings, and it has live database /
cloud / Bash access. Unprompted, it does the thorough thing: re-derives every claim from scratch,
running expensive exploratory queries (full-window joins, multi-date sweeps, dry-runs). Two failure
modes follow:

1. **It runs very long** (20–40+ min of wall time on heavy probes), far past what the review needs.
2. **It can socket-close mid-run.** The Agent tool returns `API Error: The socket connection was closed
   unexpectedly` with a non-zero `tool_uses` count but **no final assistant message** — so the agent
   did real work (11, 20 tool calls) but its **verdict was never delivered**. The output is lost, and
   it is **not resumable** from the orchestrator unless a `SendMessage`/continue tool is available
   (often it is not). You've burned the tokens and the wall-clock for nothing.

The root cause is that an unbounded reviewer treats "review this change" as "independently re-establish
the entire ground truth," which is exactly the slow, fragile thing — when the orchestrator has usually
ALREADY established that ground truth and just needs a second pair of eyes on the diff.

## Context / Trigger Conditions

- About to dispatch a code-review / verification / research agent with BigQuery / gcloud / psql / Bash.
- An `Agent` result shows `API Error: The socket connection was closed unexpectedly` plus
  `tool_uses: N (>0)`, `subagent_tokens: 0`, and no Strengths/Issues/Assessment in the output.
- A dispatched reviewer has no return after ~20–30 min.
- You (orchestrator) already ran the expensive live probes and confirmed the numbers in the PR body.

## Solution

Bound review/verify subagents explicitly in the dispatch prompt:

1. **Hard budget:** "Target under ~6 minutes, ≤8 tool calls." A reviewer with a budget self-limits to
   the high-value checks.
2. **Forbid the expensive re-derivation:** "Do NOT run BigQuery probes / multi-table joins over date
   ranges. I already verified <the specific claims> — your job is the STATIC diff review + run only the
   fast unit test (`pytest …`)." Hand it the ground truth as given facts to sanity-check cheaply, not
   to reproduce.
3. **Prefer several short bounded agents over one open-ended one** — diversity of lens at low per-agent
   risk; if one socket-closes you still have the others.
4. **On a socket-close:** capture the returned `agentId`. If a `SendMessage`/continue tool exists, try
   resuming for just the verdict (no new probing). If not, **re-dispatch a fresh bounded agent** — do
   not assume the lost agent "basically finished."

## Verification

The bounded re-dispatch returns a full verdict quickly (minutes, not tens of minutes) and does not
socket-close. A pure-docs review can finish in <1 min / ~4 tool calls.

## Example

Two parallel review agents were dispatched with live-BQ access to verify an ML-pipeline PR and told to
"adversarially verify my claims." Both ran **~34 minutes** (11 and 20 tool calls of BQ probing) and both
returned `API Error: The socket connection was closed unexpectedly` with **zero verdict** — output lost,
not resumable (`SendMessage` unavailable). Re-dispatched with "≤8 tool calls, <6 min, do NOT run BQ
probes (I already validated the delta/unmapped-code/serving checks), review the diff statically + run
the fast pytest" → both returned clean structured verdicts in ~12–13 min; a later docs-only review
returned in 28s / 4 tool calls.

## Notes

- Distinct from [[subagent-watchdog-stall-on-ui-template-track]]: that is a UI/template agent killed by
  the **600s no-output watchdog**, fixed by going inline. This is a **DB-access agent that socket-closes
  after a long live-probe run**, fixed by **bounding the probe budget** (the work IS streaming output, so
  the watchdog isn't the trigger — the transport drop is).
- The asymmetry that makes bounding safe: the orchestrator has already done the expensive verification
  (that's why it's confident enough to merge); the reviewer's value is the independent read of the DIFF
  and a cheap sanity-check of the headline numbers, not a full re-derivation.
- Pairs with the project norm "review every non-trivial PR before merge" — bounding makes that norm
  cheap and reliable instead of a coin-flip on whether the agent returns.
