  Safely bulk-clean accumulated git worktrees and branches without losing
  progress. Use when: (1) user says the repo is "messy with worktrees",
  "too many branches", "clean up the repo", "review the worktrees";
  (2) `git worktree list` / `git branch -a` shows dozens of stale entries;
  (3) you must delete many branches/worktrees but the user said "without
  losing progress" / "keep <X>". Centres on the non-obvious trap that
  `git branch --merged` and `git merge-base --is-ancestor` report false
  "NOT merged" for squash-merged branches — so safety must be gated on PR
  state, not ancestry. Covers the verify-before-delete gate, salvaging
  untracked files before `git worktree remove`, and a SHA recovery manifest.

# Safe Bulk Worktree & Branch Cleanup

## Problem

A repo accumulates dozens of git worktrees and branches over many sessions.
The user wants them cleaned up "without losing progress." Bulk-deleting is
risky in two non-obvious ways:

1. **Ancestry tests lie about squash-merged branches.** `git branch --merged`
   and `git merge-base --is-ancestor` only detect merge-commit / fast-forward
   merges. A squash merge creates a *new* commit on the trunk — the original
   branch tip is never an ancestor. In a squash-merge repo (PR titles ending
   `(#NN)`), these tools flag *almost every* merged branch as "NOT merged."
   Trusting them either blocks the cleanup or, worse, makes you think real
   work would be lost.
2. **`git worktree remove` silently discards untracked files.** Removing a
   worktree never deletes commits (the branch + history persist), but any
   *uncommitted / untracked* files in that worktree's directory are gone.

## Context / Trigger Conditions

- User: "this repo is messy with all the worktrees", "clean up the branches",
  "review the rest and help me clean up without losing progress".
- `git worktree list` shows many `.claude/worktrees/*` or `/tmp/*` entries.
- `git branch -a` shows dozens of stale `feature/*`, `claude/*`, `docs/*` branches.
- A bulk branch/worktree deletion where the user named something to keep.

## Solution

### 1. Inventory (read-only)

```bash
git worktree list                              # prunable = directory gone
git branch -a --sort=-committerdate
git fetch --all --prune                        # refresh remote-tracking refs
# per-worktree uncommitted check:
git worktree list --porcelain | awk '/^worktree /{print $2}' | while read w; do
  [ -d "$w" ] && echo "$(git -C "$w" status --porcelain | wc -l) dirty :: $w" \
              || echo "MISSING (prunable) :: $w"
done
```

### 2. Classify each branch — the verify-before-delete gate

A branch is **safe to delete** (zero progress lost) if ANY holds:
- **Tip is on a remote**: `git branch -r --contains <sha>` is non-empty.
- **Merged into the trunk**: `git merge-base --is-ancestor <sha> origin/<trunk>`.
- **Has a MERGED or CLOSED PR**: see step 3.

If NONE holds, the branch has local-only unmerged work → **keep it** (or push
it first). Do not delete it on the user's "without losing progress" instruction.

### 3. Resolve squash merges via PR state — NOT ancestry

When ancestry says "not merged," do not conclude work is unmerged. Map every
branch to its PR and use the PR's state:

```bash
gh pr list --state all --limit 300 --json number,headRefName,state,mergedAt
```

- PR **MERGED** → branch work is in the trunk (as a squash commit) → safe delete.
- PR **CLOSED** (unmerged) → team chose not to merge → stale → safe delete.
- PR **OPEN** → **keep** the branch; deleting it auto-closes the PR.
- **No PR ever** → no merge trail; treat as unverified → keep, or confirm with user.

### 4. Salvage untracked files before removing worktrees

For every worktree with untracked/modified files you intend to remove, copy
those files out first. A dedicated **salvage branch** keeps them durable:

```bash
git checkout -b salvage/worktree-cleanup-$(date +%F)
mkdir -p _salvage/<worktree-name>/ && cp <files> _salvage/<worktree-name>/
git add -f _salvage && git commit -m "chore: salvage untracked worktree files"
```

Ignore `?? .claude/` — that is Claude Code's per-worktree session dir, not content.

### 5. Write a SHA recovery manifest BEFORE deleting

Record `branch  full-sha  status` for every branch you will delete. Commit it
on the salvage branch. This makes every deletion 100 % reversible:
`git branch <name> <sha>` (then `git push origin <name>` for remotes).

### 6. Execute in order

```bash
# worktrees first (frees their branches for deletion)
git worktree remove --force <path>     # repeat; --force handles leftover untracked
git worktree prune                     # clears entries whose dir is already gone
# then branches
git branch -D <branch> ...             # -D (not -d): -d refuses squash-merged branches
git push origin --delete <b1> <b2> ... # remote branches, one push, multiple refs
```

You cannot remove the worktree you are currently inside — hand the user that
one command.

## Verification

```bash
git worktree list          # only the intended survivors
git branch -a              # keepers + trunk + protected open-PR branches
git fsck --connectivity-only --no-progress   # no corruption
```
Confirm protected items survived (the branch the user named, `main`, every
open-PR branch).

## Example

Session result: **27→5 worktrees, 79→11 local branches, 39→6 remote branches.**
Mid-run, `git merge-base --is-ancestor` flagged 32 of 33 remote branches as
"NOT MERGED" — alarming until recognised as the squash-merge artefact. Re-gating
on `gh pr list --state all` showed 21 MERGED + 5 CLOSED + 7 no-PR: all genuinely
stale. Every deleted SHA was recorded on a `salvage/worktree-cleanup-*` branch.

## Notes

- **Removing a worktree ≠ deleting a branch.** `git worktree remove` leaves the
  branch and all commits intact. The only loss surface is untracked files.
- **`git branch -d` vs `-D`:** `-d` refuses branches it thinks are unmerged
  (i.e. all squash-merged ones). Use `-D` *after* you have independently
  verified safety via step 2/3 — never as a shortcut to skip verification.
- **zsh word-splitting trap:** if your shell is zsh (the Claude Code Bash tool
  often is), `for b in $LIST` does NOT split a space-separated string — it
  iterates once over the whole blob. Wrap loops over string lists in
  `bash -c '...'`, or use zsh's `${=LIST}`. A silent off-by-everything bug.
- **Confirm before pushing remote deletions** — it is an outward action on a
  shared repo. Protect `main`, the default branch, and every open-PR branch.
- See also: `gh-pr-merge-worktree-checkout-trap` (merging when a sibling
  worktree holds the base branch), `git-recover-lost-branch` (post-hoc
  recovery), `git-pull-after-squash-merge` and
  `working-tree-edits-stranded-on-squash-merge` (other squash-merge effects).
