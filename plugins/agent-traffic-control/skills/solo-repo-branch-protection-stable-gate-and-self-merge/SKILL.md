  Configure GitHub branch protection on a solo-maintained repo so red/broken changes
  can't reach main, WITHOUT locking yourself out (no second reviewer needed). Use when:
  (1) a bad commit reached main because CI only runs after a direct push, (2) you want a
  server-side guarantee that direct pushes are blocked and the test check must be green,
  (3) "require status checks" alone isn't blocking direct pushes. Covers three non-obvious
  traps: matrix CI check-runs are named "test (20)"/"test (22)" not the workflow name, so
  pin a STABLE aggregation gate job instead; required_status_checks alone only gates PR
  MERGES (you also need require-PR to block direct pushes); and required_approving_review_count:0
  lets a solo maintainer self-merge. See also: claude-plugin-repo-ci-release,

# Solo-Repo Branch Protection: Stable Gate + Self-Merge

## Problem

You want main to be unbreakable — no direct pushes, the test check must be green before
anything lands — but you're the only maintainer, so you can't require a second reviewer,
and you don't want a config that deadlocks all merges later. Three traps make the naive
approach wrong.

## Context / Trigger Conditions

- A broken/malformed commit reached `main` because it was pushed directly (CI runs
  *after* the push lands, so a post-push workflow can't block it).
- You set "require status checks to pass" but direct pushes still go through.
- You're a solo owner and worry branch protection means you can never merge your own PRs.

## Solution

### Trap 1 — Matrix check-runs aren't named after the workflow

A workflow `name: Tests` with a job `test` and `strategy.matrix.node-version: [20, 22]`
produces check-runs named **`test (20)`** and **`test (22)`** — not `Tests`. If you
require `Tests` (the workflow name) as a status check, it never exists → no merge ever
satisfies it. If you require `test (20)`/`test (22)` directly, then changing the matrix
(drop 20, add 24) silently orphans the required context and **deadlocks all merges**.

Fix: add a stable **aggregation gate job** and require only it. `if: always()` +
checking `needs.test.result` makes it FAIL (not skip) when any matrix leg fails — a
*skipped* required check would itself deadlock merges.

```yaml
  test-gate:
    if: always()
    needs: test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Verify the test matrix succeeded
        run: |
          if [ "${{ needs.test.result }}" != "success" ]; then
            echo "test matrix did not succeed: ${{ needs.test.result }}"; exit 1
          fi
```
Push this and let it run once, then confirm the check-run name exists:
`gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/commits/main/check-runs --jq '.check_runs[].name'`.

### Trap 2 — required_status_checks alone does NOT block direct pushes

Required status checks only gate PR *merges*. To block direct pushes to main you must
also require a pull request (`required_pull_request_reviews` must be present/non-null).

### Trap 3 — Solo self-merge

Set `required_approving_review_count: 0` — a PR is required, but zero approvals, so you
can merge your own PR once the check is green. `enforce_admins: true` makes it a real
guarantee (even the owner can't bypass).

### Apply it

```bash
cat > /tmp/protection.json <<'EOF'
{
  "required_status_checks": { "strict": true, "contexts": ["test-gate"] },
  "enforce_admins": true,
  "required_pull_request_reviews": { "required_approving_review_count": 0 },
  "restrictions": null
}
EOF
gh api -X PUT repos/<owner>/<repo>/branches/main/protection --input /tmp/protection.json
```
Needs `repo` scope (`gh auth status`). Pair with a local `.githooks/pre-push` that runs
the suite for fast local failure — protection is the authoritative gate, the hook is the
fast layer.

## Verification

```bash
# config active
gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/branches/main/protection \
  --jq '{checks:.required_status_checks.contexts, admins:.enforce_admins.enabled, pr:.required_pull_request_reviews.required_approving_review_count}'
# direct push REJECTED (use --no-verify to bypass local hook and test the SERVER)
git commit --allow-empty -m probe && git push --no-verify origin main   # → GH006, "must be made through a pull request"
git reset --hard HEAD~1
# happy path still works: branch → gh pr create → wait test-gate → gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch
```
Expected rejection: `remote: error: GH006: Protected branch update failed ... Changes
must be made through a pull request. ... Required status check "test-gate" is expected.`

## Notes

- **Emergency lift** (don't get locked out if CI itself breaks): `gh api -X DELETE
  repos/<owner>/<repo>/branches/main/protection`, or PUT with `enforce_admins:false` to
  keep an admin bypass. You own the repo, so this state is always recoverable.
- `strict: true` means a branch must be up to date with main before merge (rebase if stale).
- `gh pr create --fill` aborts if run from the wrong cwd / before the branch is detected;
  pass `--repo`/`--base`/`--head` explicitly (see `gh-pr-create-orchestration-cwd-wrong-head`).
- To fan out across many solo repos, script the PUT per repo after confirming each has a
  `test-gate`-style stable check. See also `claude-plugin-repo-ci-release`.
