  Safely co-edit a deliverable WHILE another live session (a second Claude Code
  session, or a colleague's agent) is actively editing the same file. Use when:
  (1) the user warns "a parallel session is making active edits on the same file,
  don't delete each other's work / maybe only write when the other is finished",
  (2) the deliverable is BUILT from many per-item source files by an assembler
  (e.g. sections/*.html -> _assemble.py -> one big HTML; docs, slides, reports),
  (3) you must make edits without clobbering — or being clobbered by — the other
  session's concurrent work. Covers: mapping hot/cool items via source-file mtime,
  editing only disjoint sources, why an idempotent rebuild is NON-destructive
  (so your edits survive the other session's rebuild), the false-negative
  grep gotcha when verifying content landed in assembled HTML, how to CHECK
  COVERAGE ("is card X present / missing?") against the sources rather than the
  build, and the end-of-session HANDOFF/COMMIT discipline on the shared branch
  (commit only your own docs, unpushed; leave the co-owned deliverable uncommitted) —
  including the worktree-GLOBAL-index gotcha: staging then pausing lets the OTHER
  session's `git commit` absorb your staged files into its commit (stage+commit
  atomically; re-verify `git diff --cached` in the instant before committing).

# Co-editing a section-assembled deliverable alongside a live parallel session

## Problem

The user says: *"a parallel session is making active edits on the same file, so
please don't delete each other's work — maybe only write on it when the other one
is finished."* The deliverable is large and shared. The naive readings both fail:
**serialize** (do nothing until they finish — wastes the session, ignores the
user's "fan out / go fast") or **dive in blindly** (and clobber their work, which
is exactly what they warned against).

There is a third path that is fast AND safe — but only once you notice the build
model: the artifact is **assembled from per-item source files**, and the assembler
is **idempotent** (reads all sources from disk, regenerates the one output). That
changes the collision math entirely.

## Context / Trigger conditions

- User warns that another live session / agent is editing the same file; "don't
  clobber each other"; possibly "only write when the other is finished."
- The deliverable is generated: a build script (`_assemble.py`, a bundler, a
  static-site generator) inlines per-item source files (`sections/*.html`,
  partials, slides) into ONE output file. The output is a **build artifact**, not
  the source of truth.
- You need to make real edits this session without losing concurrent work.

## Solution

1. **Find the build model FIRST. Never hand-edit the assembled OUTPUT.** Locate the
   assembler and confirm the big file is generated from per-item sources. Edit the
   **source files**; the output is regenerated. (If you edit the 2 MB assembled
   HTML directly, the next rebuild by either session silently overwrites you.)

2. **Map hot/cool per item via SOURCE-FILE mtime** — this is your real-time
   ownership signal, no git needed:
   ```sh
   stat -f '%Sm %N' -t '%H:%M:%S' sections/*.html      # BSD/macOS
   # or: ls --time-style=+%H:%M:%S -l sections/*.html   # GNU
   ```
   Files touched in the last few minutes = the other session's **HOT** set; old
   mtimes = **COOL**. Re-stat right before each edit batch — the other session
   moves between cards/items quickly (a broad pass can touch 6+ files in minutes).

3. **Edit ONLY cool, disjoint source files.** Two sessions on *different* source
   files never clobber each other — last-writer-wins only bites the **same** file.
   So staying on disjoint items satisfies "don't delete each other's work" without
   serializing. Ask the user to confirm ownership at item granularity ("does the
   other session own items 1–9 and I take 10 + the analysis?").

4. **An idempotent rebuild is NON-destructive — this is the key insight.** The
   assembler reads ALL source files from disk and regenerates the output, so *any*
   session's rebuild **auto-merges everyone's saved source edits**. Your edits
   survive the other session's rebuild, and theirs survive yours — *as long as all
   edits live in the SOURCES, not the output*. You don't even have to rebuild
   yourself: the next rebuild by anyone picks up your saved sources. (Verified: my
   edits to one card survived the other session's rebuild that happened minutes
   later; that rebuild pulled my changes into the output untouched.)

5. **The only two real collision surfaces — avoid both during the active window:**
   (a) both sessions editing the **same** source file; (b) editing the **shared
   assembler/config** (e.g. reordering items in `_assemble.py`, which also
   renumbers everything). If the ask is "position X near Y," prefer a
   **cross-reference note** inside the (disjoint) source files over a physical
   reorder of the shared assembler. Defer structural reorders until the other
   session is done.

6. **Verify your edits survived.** After the other session bumps the mtime of a
   file you edited, RE-READ it to confirm your changes are intact. (The Edit tool
   also errors on stale state, so a blind edit fails safe rather than clobbering.)

7. **Rebuild only when sanctioned** ("rebuild now") — then verify the OUTPUT
   contains every session's content.

## Verification

- Rebuild cleanly: check the assembler's success line, the item/card count, and
  that all referenced assets embedded (no "missing []").
- **Confirm your content landed — strip tags AND normalize whitespace before
  grepping.** A line-based `grep "my exact phrase"` on assembled HTML gives
  **false negatives** when the phrase wraps across a source line break OR an inline
  tag (`<i>`, `<b>`) sits mid-phrase. Use:
  ```sh
  python3 -c "import re,sys; t=re.sub(r'\s+',' ', re.sub(r'<[^>]+>',' ', open(sys.argv[1]).read())); print(sys.argv[2] in t)" OUT.html "my exact phrase"
  ```
- **To decide whether a card/consideration is ALREADY present (or "missing"),
  grep + READ the SOURCE section files — NOT the assembled output.** The
  tag-stripped check above answers "does this phrase appear *anywhere* in the
  build", which is the wrong question for coverage: the build can be **stale**
  vs the sources, AND a tag-stripped scan **over-matches** when the term appears
  in an *unrelated* card (checking if the ruled-out section covered "Distance from
  campus" false-*positived* on card 09's "by distance" FA figure). So the build
  grep fails **both** ways — false-negative raw (tags/wraps), false-positive
  tag-stripped (cross-section collision). Before a handoff/plan declares a card
  missing → "go build it", confirm against `sections/*.html`. See
  `shipped-change-not-visible-deploy-vs-gate-vs-cache` (Step 0) + lessons #181.
- **Confirm the OTHER session's work is still present** in the output (grep a
  marker of their concurrent additions) — proves the rebuild merged, not lost, it.

## Example (the client dossier, 2026-06-30)

Two live sessions co-editing `decision_dossier_ENRICHED.html`, assembled from
`sections/*.html` via `_assemble.py`. `stat` showed the other session sweeping
cards 01–09 (mtimes in the last ~5 min); my targets 07/08b/10 were cool (hours
old). I edited 08b first; the other session's later rebuild (16:12) pulled my 08b
edits into the output cleanly. When they moved onto 09, I held the 09 cross-ref
until the user gave me explicit ownership of all four cards. I used cross-reference
notes (07↔09) instead of physically reordering cards (which would have meant
editing the shared `_assemble.py`). Final rebuild verified all four of my cards
**and** the other session's card-09 enrichment present; two "missing" greps turned
out to be a line-wrap and an inline `<i>` tag (false negatives), confirmed by the
tag-stripped check.

## Variant — end-of-session handoff/commit on the shared branch (session-handoff Phase 4)

When you wrap up (e.g. `/session-handoff`) while the deliverable is still co-edited
live on a **shared branch**, the handoff skill's default *"commit ALL work → open a
PR → auto-merge docs"* is **wrong** and will entangle or ship the other session's
in-progress work. `git status` on the shared worktree shows **both sessions' edits
intermixed** — there is no clean per-session diff. Invert Phase 4:

1. **Do NOT commit the co-owned deliverable.** Your source edits are saved on disk
   and the idempotent rebuild already merges them. Committing now (a) entangles the
   other session's WIP in your commit and (b) ships a half-done, often gated
   (`DO-NOT-MERGE`) artifact. Leaving the deliverable **saved-but-uncommitted** for
   the worktree owner / post-sign-off commit *is* the protocol, not a loose end.
2. **Commit ONLY your own doc artifacts** (handoff doc, next-session prompt),
   **path-staged by exact filename** — never `git add -A`/`-u`, which sweeps the
   other session's files + untracked build scripts
   (`git-add-all-sweeps-untracked-artifacts-into-commit`).
   - **The index is worktree-GLOBAL — don't stage-then-pause.** `git add` writes to
     the one shared index; if the other session runs **its** `git commit` (even a
     plain commit, no `-a`) while your files sit staged, **your staged files ship in
     ITS commit** — you never ran `git commit`. Observed 2026-07-01: path-staged
     cards 08/10 were absorbed into the parallel session's `f9e63216` ("dossier card
     1B…"). Mitigate: run `git add <paths>` and `git commit` **atomically in the same
     step**, and re-check `git diff --cached --name-only` shows **exactly your paths**
     in the instant before committing (abort if a foreign path appears). If you'd
     rather your content edits land in the *other* session's commit anyway (the owner
     is actively rebuilding that file), just leave them **unstaged** and let it fold
     them in. See `lesson_shared_worktree_staging_absorbed_by_parallel_commit` (the client
     project memory).
3. **Never push.** A shared branch usually carries the other session's **unpushed**
   commits (`git log @{u}..HEAD` shows them above origin); pushing publishes their
   work. The other session owns the push.
4. **Don't amend** a commit another session/issue may reference — add a new small
   commit (preserves the SHA your handoff/issue cited).
5. **Memory index near its size cap?** UPDATE an existing memory file (no new
   `MEMORY.md` index line) instead of adding one.
6. **File the follow-up as a labeled issue** so it's tracked independently of the
   unpushed/gated branch (the next session may start from a fresh worktree off it).
7. If docs genuinely must reach `main` now, land them via a **separate worktree off
   `origin/main`** (a "safe-docs PR" excluding the gated deliverable) — never
   branch-switch the shared/active branch.

Net (verified the client dossier 2026-06-30c): 2 path-staged doc commits, unpushed, atop
the other session's commits; every deliverable edit (yours + theirs) left
uncommitted; one labeled follow-up issue; an existing memory file updated in place.

## Notes

- The user's "maybe only write when the other is finished" is a safe *default*, not
  a hard rule — with the source/assembler model you can co-edit disjoint sources
  immediately and let the idempotent rebuild merge. Surface the coordination
  question (who owns what) rather than stalling.
- This is **filesystem coordination, not git** — no branches. Distinct from
  `shared-file-redesign-parallel-author-serial-integrate` (one orchestrator
  authoring handoff prompts / in-session fan-out) and
  `large-redesign-parallel-branch-collision-audit` (git-branch collisions).
- Worktree note: the deliverable may live in a *different* worktree than your cwd;
  edit it by absolute path there, and remember the user's `file://` URL points at
  that worktree's copy.
