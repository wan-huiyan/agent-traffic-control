  Pass design specs, handoff prompts, or any other shared artefact between
  two parallel Claude Code sessions that are working in different git
  worktrees on different branches — without merging the producing branch
  to main first. Use when: (1) session A produced design docs / a handoff
  prompt / a mockup file on branch X, (2) session B (different cwd /
  different worktree, on branch Y branched from main) reports "the file
  doesn't exist" or "I can't find the design spec you mentioned",
  (3) you want B unblocked NOW without a PR review cycle, (4) both
  worktrees are local checkouts of the same repo (share `.git`).
  The unblock: `git checkout <producing-branch> -- <paths>` from inside
  B's worktree pulls the files in as staged additions, no merge needed.
  Also covers the related gitignore-exception trick when the artefact
  files are blanket-ignored (e.g., `*.html` in a repo that produces HTML
  deliverables but also keeps design mockups under `docs/`).
  v1.1.0 (2026-05-26) adds the diagnostic-search variant: when the user
  says "execute <path/to/file>" but the file isn't in your worktree, use
  `git log --all --oneline --diff-filter=A -- "<path>"` + `git branch -a
  --contains <sha>` to find which branch holds it, then `git show
  <branch>:<path>` for read-only access without modifying your tree.

# Cross-worktree spec handoff via `git checkout <branch> -- <paths>`

## Problem

You ran a brainstorming / design session in Claude Code session A. Output:
design spec doc, a handoff prompt, a vibe mockup HTML. You committed them
on branch `worktree-spec-A` in `.claude/worktrees/spec-A/`.

You then started Claude Code session B in a different worktree, on a fresh
branch `feat/something-B` branched from `main`. Session B is supposed to
consume the design spec — but the spec doc, handoff prompt, and mockup
files **don't exist** in B's working tree, because B's branch was cut from
main before A's commits landed and the commits never made it to main.

Session B reports: "the referenced design spec files don't exist in the
handover. Let me look at what's available." → it's blocked.

The naive fix is "merge A's branch into main, then B pulls main". That
needs a PR review cycle. Slow.

## Context / Trigger Conditions

All of:

- Two (or more) Claude Code sessions are running in parallel, in
  **different worktrees** of the same repo. (`git worktree list` shows
  multiple paths.)
- Session A (the producer) committed artefacts — design docs, plans, spec
  files, mockups, fixtures, prompts — on a branch that is **not** the base
  branch of session B.
- Session B (the consumer) is on a branch branched from `main` (or any
  ancestor that predates A's commits) and cannot see A's files via
  `ls` or Read.
- B reports a "file not found" / "doesn't exist" / "can't see the spec"
  symptom referencing files that you (or session A) know exist on disk
  *somewhere else*.

Smoking-gun signals:
- The missing file's path matches one you (or A) named in a recent message
  ("the spec is at `docs/plans/...`").
- `git log --all --oneline -- <path>` shows the file was committed on a
  branch that isn't an ancestor of B's branch.
- `git worktree list` shows 2+ worktrees; the file exists in one but not
  the other.

Note: this is distinct from
[[multi-worktree-file-url-stale-content]] (browser opens stale file://
URL), [[subagent-bash-cd-wrong-worktree]] (subagent operates in the wrong
cwd), and [[worktree-outer-ls-mistaken-for-main-state]] (parent dir
listing not reflecting worktree state). Those are all "wrong working
directory" issues; this one is "right working directory, file genuinely
isn't there yet because it lives on a different branch."

## Solution

### Variant — handoff prompt missing from current worktree (read-only diagnostic)

Added 2026-05-26 (v1.1.0). The original skill below assumes you already know
which branch holds the missing artefact. If you DON'T — the user told you to
execute a handoff prompt (e.g., `docs/handoffs/session_N_prompt.md`) and it
doesn't exist in your current worktree — start with this diagnostic search
BEFORE jumping to Step 1.

Trigger: user says "execute `docs/handoffs/session_NN_prompt.md`" (or any
specific file path) and `Read` / `ls` reports the file doesn't exist on disk.

```bash
# 1. Find which commits anywhere in the repo first introduced this file
git log --all --oneline --diff-filter=A -- "*session_NN_prompt*" 2>&1 | head -10
# Example output:
#   5307eb9 docs(s69): handoff + S70 prompt — 3 PRs shipped ...
#   79d27d3 docs(s69): handoff + S70 prompt — 3 PRs shipped ...

# 2. Find which branches contain those commits
git branch -a --contains 5307eb9 2>&1 | head -5
# Example output:
#   remotes/origin/starbucks-uk

# 3. Read the file directly without modifying your working tree
git show origin/starbucks-uk:docs/handoffs/session_70_prompt.md | less
# or pipe to sed/grep for a section, or `gh` if it's already on GitHub
```

This is **read-only** — no checkout, no working-tree changes. Useful when
you just need to **read** the prompt to understand what to do; the full
Step 1→4 checkout flow below is for when subagents or downstream tooling
need the file to exist on disk in your worktree.

If `git log --all --diff-filter=A -- <path>` returns empty:
- The file was committed under a different filename (was renamed) — try
  without the path filter: `git log --all --oneline --grep="session_NN"`
- The file was never committed (only exists on someone else's local
  worktree, never pushed) — you can't recover it via git
- The path is wrong — double-check with `git ls-tree -r origin/<branch> --
  | grep -i <keyword>`

After you confirm the branch holding the file, proceed to Step 1 below if
you need it on disk; or just `git show <branch>:<path>` repeatedly if
read-only access is sufficient.

### Step 1 — confirm the diagnosis

From inside session B's worktree:

```bash
# Is the file on disk here?
ls path/to/the/file 2>/dev/null && echo "present" || echo "missing"

# What branches contain commits touching this path?
git log --all --oneline -- path/to/the/file | head -5

# Does B's current branch include any of those commits?
git merge-base --is-ancestor <commit-from-log> HEAD && echo "in B" || echo "not in B"
```

If "missing" + commits exist on a branch + that branch is not an ancestor
of B → confirmed.

### Step 2 — pull the files into B's working tree

From inside B's worktree (cwd is B's checkout):

```bash
git checkout <producing-branch> -- \
  path/to/file-1 \
  path/to/file-2 \
  path/to/directory/  # trailing slash works for whole dirs
```

This is `git checkout <tree-ish> -- <path>`. It:

- Brings the file contents from `<producing-branch>` into B's working tree.
- Stages the additions/modifications (visible in `git status` as "Changes
  to be committed").
- Does **not** switch branches, does **not** create a merge commit, does
  **not** affect any other file in B's tree.
- Works without a fetch when both branches are local (both worktrees share
  `.git`).
- Works for both files and directories. For directories, every file under
  the directory at that commit is pulled in.

### Step 3 — if the file is gitignored, add an exception

If the file you're pulling in is gitignored (common for HTML mockups in a
repo whose `.gitignore` has a blanket `*.html`), the checkout still works
(it brings the bytes into the working tree), but the file shows as
*staged-add despite being ignored* — slightly confusing. To track it
going forward:

```bash
# Find the ignore rule
git check-ignore -v <path>
# .gitignore:N:*.html	docs/plans/.../foo.html

# Add an exception. Don't broaden too far — scope to the design directory.
echo "!docs/plans/**/*.html" >> .gitignore
```

Then commit `.gitignore` together with the checked-out files so future
edits stay tracked.

### Step 4 — commit on B's branch

```bash
git add .gitignore  # if you added an exception
git commit -m "import spec + mockups from worktree-spec-A for design pass"
```

The spec now lives on B's branch too. When B's PR eventually opens, it
includes both the spec it consumed and the design it produced — single
self-contained PR. (If A's branch later also opens a PR with the same
files, GitHub's squash-merge will deduplicate cleanly.)

## Verification

- `ls <path>` from B's worktree now lists the file.
- `git status` shows the files as "Changes to be committed: new file: ..."
  (or "modified" if they existed at older content).
- The consuming Claude Code session (B) can `Read` the files without
  "file not found" errors.

## Example

This session:

```
.claude/worktrees/session13-resume/   ← session A (producer)
  branch: worktree-session13-resume
  HEAD: 303da93 docs(ui): vibe mockups + gitignore exception
  files: docs/plans/2026-05-26-amc-brief-runner-ui-v2-{design,handoff-prompt}.md
         docs/plans/2026-05-26-vibe-mockups/{index,option-a,option-b,option-c}.html

/Users/huiyanwan/Documents/AMC-handover/   ← session B (consumer)
  branch: feat/amc-brief-runner-ui-mockup-v2 (branched from main = 755e042)
  HEAD: 755e042 — does NOT include any of A's commits

  Symptom: session B's frontend-design pass reported
  "The referenced design spec and visual anchor files don't exist."
```

Unblock from B's worktree:

```bash
cd /Users/huiyanwan/Documents/AMC-handover
git checkout worktree-session13-resume -- \
  docs/plans/2026-05-26-amc-brief-runner-ui-v2-design.md \
  docs/plans/2026-05-26-amc-brief-runner-ui-v2-handoff-prompt.md \
  docs/plans/2026-05-26-vibe-mockups/ \
  .gitignore
git status   # all five files staged
```

Session B's frontend-design pass now reads the files and proceeds.

## Notes

- **Local-only branches work too.** Because both worktrees share `.git`,
  you don't need to push the producer branch to origin first. (Pushing is
  still a good idea if anyone else needs the work, or if you'll open a PR
  later — but it's not required for the cross-worktree handoff itself.)
- **Don't `git checkout <branch>` (no `--`)** — that switches branches in
  B's worktree and loses B's in-progress work. The `--` is the critical
  delimiter that makes it a path-restoration, not a branch-switch.
- **Order matters for big handoffs**: pull `.gitignore` first (so newly
  imported HTML files aren't surfaced as "ignored" oddities in git
  status), then the spec / mockup files.
- **Subagents spawned by B** also need the files visible in B's cwd — the
  checkout has to happen before they're dispatched. If a subagent already
  failed with "file not found", do the checkout in the parent session and
  redispatch.
- **Alternative when you don't want it on B's branch yet**: use
  `git show <branch>:<path>` to print a file's content without modifying
  the working tree. Useful for one-off "let me see what A's spec says"
  but doesn't help if B's subagents need to `Read` the file (they'd need
  it on disk).
- **Distinct from `claude-design-handoff-bundle`**: that skill is for
  fetching gzipped tar bundles from `claude.ai/design` URLs (a different
  artefact-transfer mechanism, between Claude Design and Claude Code).
  This skill is local: between two Claude Code sessions in different
  worktrees of the same repo.
