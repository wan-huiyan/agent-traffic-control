description: Coordinate GitHub issue pickup across parallel Claude Code sessions (or human + agent) using BOTH `assignees` and a `wip` label, so sibling sessions detect the claim and skip. Use BEFORE writing any code that closes / addresses a GitHub issue when there's any chance another session is working the same repo. Trigger on phrases like "pick up issue #N", "work on #N", "let's grab the next one from the backlog", "implement the bug-tagged issues", "start the next session", "before I start coding on this issue", "did anyone else pick this up?", "is anyone on #N?", "another session is working on…", "WIP label", "in-progress label", "issue lock", "agent claim", "claim the issue", "release the claim". ALSO trigger when the user explicitly runs multiple parallel sessions / worktrees on the same repo, when an agent is dispatched to "work through the open issues", or when about to file a PR with `Closes #N`. NOT for: filing new issues, commenting without claiming, reviewing PRs, single-session work with no parallel risk, or changes that aren't backed by an issue.

# GitHub issue claim coordination (assignee + label)

When multiple Claude Code sessions (or human + agent) work the same repo in parallel, two sessions can independently pick up the same issue, do parallel implementations, and collide at PR time — burning hours of duplicated work and forcing one branch to be rebased or abandoned.

**Default agent behaviour is silent.** An agent dispatched to "work on the bug-tagged issues" does not automatically check whether another session is already on issue #N. There's no built-in coordination unless this skill (or equivalent) runs at pickup.

This skill installs a 60-second protocol — preflight check, atomic claim, stale-claim sweep, release on completion — using two GitHub-native primitives so the claim is visible everywhere (issue list UI, `gh issue list`, dashboards, sibling sessions).

## Why both `assignee` AND a `wip` label?

They cost ~0 to set together and cover different failure modes:

- **`assignees`** is GitHub's canonical "who's on this" primitive. `gh issue list --assignee ""` cleanly enumerates unclaimed work; agents tend to surface assignees in their own context without prompting.
- **A `wip` label** is far more visible in the GitHub issue list UI (a coloured chip next to the title) and lets you find every active claim with one query: `gh issue list --label wip`. It also survives the case where someone reassigns the issue without thinking about coordination.

Belt and suspenders. If the assignee gets dropped on a bulk edit, the label still flags it; if the label gets dropped, the assignee still says it.

## Pickup protocol

### Step 0: Ensure the `wip` label exists (idempotent — runs every time)

Don't carry "did I do the setup yet?" state. The label create is cheap and noisy on success only the first time; on subsequent runs it just exits non-zero with "already exists", which `|| true` swallows. Bake it into every pickup so a fresh repo or a teammate's repo just works.

```bash
gh label create wip \
  --description "Claimed by an active session — do not start parallel work" \
  --color FBCA04 \
  || true
```

If this fails with a permissions error (rare; happens on repos where your account can't manage labels), fall back to assignee-only claim and tell the user.

### Step 1: Preflight (single command, returns JSON)

Before writing any code for an issue:

```bash
ISSUE=123  # the issue you're about to start

gh issue view "$ISSUE" \
  --json number,state,assignees,labels,updatedAt \
  --jq '{number, state, assignees: [.assignees[].login], labels: [.labels[].name], updatedAt}'
```

Read the result against this decision table:

| State + assignees + labels                                         | Action                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `OPEN`, `assignees: []`, no `wip` label                            | **Free — claim it.** Proceed to claim step.                                                                                                         |
| `OPEN`, assigned to you, has `wip` label                           | **Yours — resume.** No re-claim needed.                                                                                                             |
| `OPEN`, assigned to someone else, OR `wip` label set by another    | **STOP.** Surface to user with assignee + `updatedAt`. Do not start parallel work.                                                                  |
| `OPEN`, has `wip` but `updatedAt` > stale window with no linked PR | Likely abandoned — see [Stale-claim sweep](#stale-claim-sweep) before claiming.                                                                     |
| `CLOSED`                                                           | Issue is done. Confirm scope with user before reopening; the merged PR's diff may already cover what you were going to build.                       |

### Step 2: Claim (after preflight clears)

```bash
gh issue edit "$ISSUE" --add-assignee @me --add-label wip
```

These are independent edits — both should succeed (Step 0 already ensured the `wip` label exists). If only one succeeds because of a transient blip, retry the missing one before starting work. A half-claim is worse than no claim because it confuses future preflights.

### Step 2 (alternative): Surface a collision

When the preflight shows another session has the claim, **do not proceed**. Tell the user something like:

> Issue #123 is currently claimed by `@other-session` (`wip` label, last touched 2h ago at 2026-05-08T09:14Z). Want me to (a) wait, (b) work on a different issue, or (c) override the claim because you know that session is dead?

The user owns the override decision. They might know the other session crashed; they might not. Surfacing the timestamp + claimant lets them choose; do not unilaterally override.

## Stale-claim sweep

Sessions crash, get cancelled, get forgotten. Without a sweep, a stale `wip` label can lock an issue forever.

**Default rule:** a claim is stale if `updatedAt` is more than **24 hours** old AND no PR is linked. Adjust the window to your workflow (shorter for fast-moving repos, longer if multi-day issues are normal).

Find candidates:

```bash
gh issue list --label wip --state open \
  --json number,title,assignees,updatedAt,url \
  --jq '.[] | select((now - (.updatedAt | fromdateiso8601)) > 86400)'
```

(`86400` = 24 hours in seconds. Change to `43200` for 12h, `14400` for 4h, etc.)

When you find a stale claim, **ask the user before clearing it** — the assignee may have paused intentionally (waiting on an external dep, debugging out of band, etc.). If cleared, drop both:

```bash
gh issue edit "$ISSUE" --remove-assignee <stale-assignee> --remove-label wip
```

## Release on completion

GitHub auto-handles the happy path: a merged PR with a closing keyword (`Closes #123` / `Fixes #123` / `Resolves #123`) closes the issue and the assignee becomes irrelevant. The `wip` label, however, is **not** auto-removed by PR merge — and a CLOSED issue still showing `wip` clutters `gh issue list --label wip` and confuses future stale-claim sweeps.

After PR merge, drop the `wip` label:

```bash
gh issue edit "$ISSUE" --remove-label wip
```

The assignee can stay (it's useful history of who shipped the fix). Only the label needs cleaning.

### Partial-scope guardrail

If your PR only addresses **part** of an issue (`Addresses Part 1.3 of #500` rather than `Closes #500`), keep the issue claimed:

- Do **not** remove the `wip` label after merging the partial PR.
- Do **not** remove yourself as assignee.
- The claim continues until **all** in-scope parts ship.

GitHub's closing-keyword parser is permissive enough to auto-close the parent issue on partial PRs if the wording drifts (e.g. `Closes Part 1 of #500` will close #500 wholesale). The defensive PR-body phrasing ("Addresses Part X of #N", no closing keyword anywhere near `#N`) is independent guidance — see the project memory file `feedback_pr_partial_close_phrasing.md` if you have one.

## When NOT to use this skill

- **Single-session work** with zero parallel risk. The 60-second protocol is overhead with no benefit.
- **Filing new issues.** Claim happens at pickup, not creation.
- **Just reading or commenting** on an issue. The claim signals "I'm about to write code for this," not "I'm thinking about this."
- **Repos where your account can't be assigned** (rare; surfaces as a `gh issue edit` error). Fall back to label-only with a comment recording your session ID.

## Quick reference

```bash
# Pickup (Step 0: ensure label exists — idempotent, runs every time)
ISSUE=123
gh label create wip --color FBCA04 \
  --description "Claimed by an active session — do not start parallel work" || true

gh issue view "$ISSUE" --json number,state,assignees,labels,updatedAt \
  --jq '{number, state, assignees: [.assignees[].login], labels: [.labels[].name], updatedAt}'
# (read decision table; if free:)
gh issue edit "$ISSUE" --add-assignee @me --add-label wip

# Stale sweep (24h window)
gh issue list --label wip --state open \
  --json number,title,assignees,updatedAt,url \
  --jq '.[] | select((now - (.updatedAt | fromdateiso8601)) > 86400)'

# Release after merge (only the label; assignee can stay)
gh issue edit "$ISSUE" --remove-label wip
```

## Sister skills / memory entries

- **`feedback_track_partial_batch_filings.md`** — different problem (knowing what YOU filed when a sandbox cancels mid-batch). This skill prevents the upstream collision; that one cleans up after a different failure mode.
- **`feedback_coordination_framing_for_parallel_artifact_collisions.md`** — what to do AFTER two parallel artifacts have already collided. This skill prevents the collision; that one frames the recovery.
- **`feedback_pr_partial_close_phrasing.md`** — keeps GitHub's closing-keyword parser from auto-closing on partial PRs. Pairs with the partial-scope guardrail above.
- **`barryu-pr-conflict-site-regen`** — resolves rebase conflicts when parallel PRs collide on generated site files. Downstream of a missed claim; if this skill runs, that one fires less often.
