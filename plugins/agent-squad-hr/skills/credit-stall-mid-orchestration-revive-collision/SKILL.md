  Recover gracefully when an Anthropic credit/billing failure stalls multiple in-flight

# Credit-stall mid-orchestration: revive-collision recovery

## Problem

You're orchestrating N parallel subagents (Task tool with `run_in_background: true`),
each working on independent tracks (e.g., one PR per track). Mid-run, an Anthropic
billing/credit failure or other transient harness outage hits — all in-flight subagents
freeze simultaneously. The user fixes billing, reports back, and asks you to continue.

**The trap:** stalled subagents are NOT dead — they're suspended at the harness layer.
When API access is restored, the harness can auto-resume them from the exact tool-call
boundary they froze on. If you naively relaunch "resume" agents to pick up where you
think the originals stopped, you end up with TWO agents racing on:

- The same git branch (one commits + pushes, the other rebases on top of stale state)
- The same PR (duplicate review comments, conflicting label changes)
- The same files (one Edit lands, then the other Edit overwrites)

Symptoms when this happens: PR has two "no issues found" review comments, force-push
storms as both agents rebase, agent A reports "PR already merged" while agent B is
still polling CI for that same PR.

**Severity ladder** (observed in an earlier session, 2026-05-08, all three originals revived ~2hr
post-stall):

1. **Best case (Track A original)**: revives mid-implementation, notices the merged
   PR via subsequent harness signals, sends a status update, terminates. Resume agent
   had pivoted to value-add (PR #571) under a state-aware brief. **No debris.**
2. **Middle case (Track C original)**: revives, runs `git diff origin/main HEAD --
   <files>`, finds zero diff on feature files, recommends "do not file PR / delete
   branch", terminates. **No PR debris**, just a status-report task-notification.
3. **Worst case (Track D original)**: revives, FILES a full duplicate PR against the
   already-merged branch (recreating the deleted remote branch via push), THEN runs
   its diff check, detects the collision, posts a "close as superseded" comment to
   its own duplicate PR, terminates. **Debris: 1 open PR + recreated remote branch
   → orchestrator must close + delete.**

The original agent's behavior on revive is non-uniform because it depends on which
tool-call boundary the harness froze it at. If frozen pre-implementation, it does
the safe thing. If frozen post-push-pre-PR, it files a duplicate PR before any
sanity check fires.

## Context / Trigger Conditions

ALL of the following:

1. You dispatched 2+ parallel subagents in the same session
2. A `<task-notification>` storm of `completed` events stopped or stayed silent for
   significantly longer than each agent's typical heartbeat — OR the user reports
   billing / credit / connection errors mid-session
3. The user has confirmed the underlying issue is resolved ("credit issue is fixed",
   "I added more credits", "API access restored")
4. You're about to do ONE of:
   - Send a follow-up message to a stalled agent
   - Launch a "resume" agent for a stalled task
   - Take over the work in the main thread

The probability of revive-collision rises with the number of parallel agents and the
duration of the stall. Single-agent sessions usually don't hit this — the harness
either resumes the one agent or doesn't.

## Solution

### Step 1 — Diagnose the actual stall state per agent (BEFORE relaunching)

Don't trust "no completion notification" alone. Check three signals per stalled agent:

**A. JSONL transcript mtime** — proves whether the agent is making any moves at all:

```bash
# The output_file in the task-notification is a symlink. Use -L to follow.
stat -f "%Sm  %z bytes  %N" -L /private/tmp/claude-PID/...task-id.output
```

If mtime hasn't advanced in >5 min AND the file size hasn't grown, the agent is stalled
at the harness layer (no API responses landing). If mtime is fresh (<2 min ago), the
agent is alive and you should NOT launch a resume — wait for it.

**B. Worktree state** — proves what the agent had finished before stalling:

```bash
cd <worktree-path>
git log --oneline origin/main..HEAD     # any commits made?
git status -sb                          # any uncommitted modifications?
git ls-remote origin <branch-name>      # was the branch pushed?
```

This tells you the **last visible side effect** the agent achieved. Possibilities:

| Worktree state                                 | Agent had reached            | Resume strategy                  |
|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Clean, no commits, no remote branch            | Just started reading         | Restart from scratch             |
| Modified files, no commits                     | Mid-implementation           | Resume with WIP-state brief      |
| Committed locally, not pushed                  | Code done, no PR yet         | Resume with "push + open PR"     |
| Committed + pushed, no PR                      | Pushed but no PR             | Resume with "open PR + merge"    |
| PR opened, OPEN state                          | PR opened, in CI/review      | Don't relaunch — verify yourself |
| PR MERGED                                      | All done                     | Don't relaunch — declare victory |

**C. PR state via gh CLI** — proves the externally-visible end state:

```bash
gh pr list --repo <repo> --state all --search "head:<branch>" \
  --json number,state,mergedAt,mergeCommit
```

A MERGED state trumps everything else: the original agent finished. Never launch a
resume on a MERGED branch — at best you'll do redundant work; at worst you'll add a
fixup commit to a deleted branch.

### Step 2 — Write state-aware resume briefs

If you decide to relaunch, the resume brief MUST:

1. **State the verified current state explicitly** ("Branch has 1 commit; pushed; no
   PR opened yet" — not "agent stalled mid-run")
2. **Tell the agent to verify state on entry** before doing anything
3. **Authorize pivoting to value-add work** if the original has already finished
   ("If you discover PR is already merged, do not redo the work; instead, look for
   complementary cleanup such as test re-enablement, tracker finalization, or
   follow-up issue filing")
4. **Explicitly say: do NOT force-push if the branch already has a PR** — let the
   original agent (which may revive) own the branch

### Step 3 — Anticipate revive collision; design for it

When you launch a resume agent, ALSO assume the original will revive in parallel.
Concretely:

- **Don't launch the resume on the same branch** if the original might still hold it.
  Cut a fresh branch named `resume/<original-branch>` if the work needs to be done
  out-of-band.
- **If the original revives mid-stream and reports completion**, the resume agent
  should detect this (via `gh pr view` or `git log origin/main`) and gracefully
  pivot — that's why Step 2's pivot authorization matters.
- **Watch for two-review-comment patterns** on the PR after merge — that's
  diagnostic evidence the collision happened. Not actually broken, just noisy.
- **Watch for duplicate PRs filed against already-merged branches** — original
  agent revives at a post-push-pre-PR tool-call boundary, recreates the deleted
  remote branch via `git push`, files a fresh duplicate PR, THEN runs its diff
  check and self-reports "close as superseded". Orchestrator must:
  ```bash
  gh pr close <duplicate#> --comment "Closing as superseded — PR #<canonical> shipped this. <link to credit-stall skill>."
  gh api -X DELETE repos/<owner>/<repo>/git/refs/heads/<branch-name>
  ```
- **You cannot reliably kill originals in flight.** The harness doesn't expose a
  clean "TaskStop a stalled agent" path that survives revival. Accept that
  originals will run to completion or budget exhaustion, and design resume briefs
  + post-merge cleanup to absorb the noise.

### Step 4 — When in doubt, take over in the main thread

If only 1-2 tracks remain and the work is simple (e.g., merge an already-green PR,
verify a deploy), do it in the main orchestrator thread. Don't burn a fresh subagent
budget waiting on `gh pr checks --watch` polling.

## Verification

After dispatching resume briefs:

```bash
# Confirm only one agent is making progress on each branch
for branch in feat/track-A feat/track-B feat/track-C; do
  echo "=== $branch ==="
  gh pr list --repo <repo> --state all --search "head:$branch" \
    --json number,state,headRefName,updatedAt --jq '.[] | {number, state, updatedAt}'
done

# Check for force-push storms (revive collision symptom)
gh pr view <PR#> --repo <repo> --json commits --jq '.commits | length'
# >5 force-pushes in a few minutes = collision smell
```

After all PRs merge, check for the dual-review-comment fingerprint:

```bash
gh pr view <PR#> --repo <repo> --comments | grep -c "No issues found"
# 2 = revive collision happened on review pass
```

Also check for late-filed duplicate PRs ~1-3hr after the canonical PR merged:

```bash
gh pr list --repo <repo> --state open \
  --json number,title,headRefName,createdAt --jq '.[] | select(.title | contains("<keyword from canonical PR>"))'
# Any open PR with the same title pattern as a recently-merged canonical = duplicate
```

## Example

an earlier session 4-track orchestration on the project repo (2026-05-08):

1. Dispatched 3 parallel subagents (A, B, D) at 16:30; D agent merged ~16:50.
2. Credit-balance issue hit at ~17:01 — agents A and C froze. JSONL mtimes stopped
   advancing (verified via `stat -f "%Sm" -L`). User flagged the issue.
3. User confirmed credit fix at ~17:10. Diagnosed each worktree:
   - A had 6 modified files, 0 commits, behind 6 → mid-implementation
   - C had clean tree, 0 commits → just started
   - D had 1 commit, pushed, no PR → "open PR + merge" state
4. Dispatched 3 state-aware resume briefs.
5. **A's original agent revived at ~17:00 and merged PR #566 at 16:40 UTC** (before
   resume agent picked up the worktree). A's resume agent, via the state-aware brief,
   detected this on entry (`git log origin/main` showed merge), pivoted to value-add
   work: re-enabled `test_monitor_template.py` (closes #473), filed tracker
   finalization PR #571, manually closed #473.
6. C and D resume agents proceeded normally — their originals had not revived (C
   had done nothing pre-stall; D's original was paused at "open PR" step which the
   resume completed).
7. Final state: all 4 tracks shipped, 5 PRs merged, no work duplicated, no force-push
   storms. The dual-agent collision on Track A produced no harm because the resume
   brief authorized pivoting.

## Notes

- The harness behavior is "resume from last tool-call boundary, not restart". This
  is generally an asset (you don't lose progress) but creates the collision risk.
- This pattern is NOT specific to credit issues — same dynamic applies to any
  transient harness outage (MCP server unreachable, network blip, hook failure).
  Generalize trigger condition to "any cause of subagent stall that later resolves".
- The `<task-notification>` system can deliver a flood of `completed` events from a
  zombie agent doing zero-tool-use polling cycles after its main work is done. Don't
  interpret these as forward progress — check JSONL mtime + git state.
- If the orchestrator's own context is at risk of compaction, prefer "take over in
  main thread" (Step 4) over launching more subagents.
- Worktree dirty state with `UU` (both-modified, unmerged) markers is a normal step
  in `barryu-pr-conflict-site-regen` flow — don't mistake it for a stall, the agent
  is mid-rebase.
