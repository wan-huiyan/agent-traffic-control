  Avoid orchestrator-budget burn when a subagent's main work is done but it's
  still polling an external event (CI completion, auto-deploy GHA workflow,
  Cloud Build, gcloud run revision rollout, long-running test suite, etc.).
  Use when: (1) you've dispatched a subagent with a final-step instruction
  like "verify auto-deploy" / "wait for CI green" / "poll until revision
  active", (2) the subagent has already done its substantive work (PR merged,
  artifact built) and is now in a polling loop, (3) you notice repeated
  `<task-notification>` events from that agent with `tool_uses: 0` and short
  `duration_ms` (a few seconds each) — each cycle says "still waiting" or
  "still in progress" with zero forward progress, (4) each notification
  forces the orchestrator to spend a turn responding (often dozens of these
  before the external event completes). The subagent isn't broken — it's
  doing what you asked — but the polling work belongs to the ORCHESTRATOR,
  not a subagent. Captures the takeover pattern: dispatch the subagent for
  the substantive work only (with explicit "do NOT poll for deploy
  verification, return after merge"), then the orchestrator runs a one-shot
  CronCreate scheduled to fire after the expected external-event duration
  to verify and close out. Sister to `schedule-poll-orchestrator-pattern`
  (different layer: that one is for fully-scheduled multi-track workflows,
  this one is for single-subagent in-session orchestration).

# Subagent external-wait → orchestrator-takeover

## Problem

You dispatch a subagent with a brief that includes both substantive work AND
a final verification step gated on an external event:

> "1. Implement … 2. Open PR … 3. Merge … 4. **Verify auto-deploy: poll GHA
> workflow + `gcloud run revisions list` until new revision is active.**"

Step 4 is **wait work** — the subagent has nothing to compute, only to wait
and check. The harness keeps the agent task open during this wait, and each
heartbeat / external signal wakes the agent for a tiny no-op cycle:

```
status: completed · tool_uses: 0 · duration_ms: 2000 · result: "Still polling."
status: completed · tool_uses: 0 · duration_ms: 2200 · result: "In progress."
status: completed · tool_uses: 0 · duration_ms: 1800 · result: "Continuing to wait."
... × 10-20 ...
```

Each cycle costs:

- **Subagent**: ~100-300 tokens of additional context per wake (small but accumulates)
- **Orchestrator**: ~one full turn to acknowledge the notification (large — the
  orchestrator's context is bigger and every reply costs)

The orchestrator's response cost dwarfs the subagent's polling cost. Over a
13-minute Cloud Build wait, this can be ~10-20 orchestrator turns of "still
polling, will report when done" — a non-trivial budget tax for zero work.

## Context / Trigger Conditions

ALL of the following:

1. You dispatched a subagent (Task tool with `run_in_background: true`)
2. The subagent's brief includes a "wait + verify" step at the end
3. You're seeing repeated `<task-notification>` events from that agent with:
   - `status: completed`
   - `tool_uses: 0`
   - Short `duration_ms` (1-30s)
   - `result` saying some variant of "still polling / in progress / waiting"

The earlier in the wait you notice this, the more orchestrator budget you save
by taking over.

## Solution

### Preventive (write better briefs from the start)

In any subagent brief that includes external-event verification, replace the
"poll until done" step with EITHER:

**Option 1 — Subagent returns after the artifact is shipped, orchestrator verifies:**

```
9. `gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch <PR#>`
10. **Return immediately** with the merge commit SHA. Do NOT wait for the
    auto-deploy GHA workflow or Cloud Run revision rollout — the
    orchestrator handles that verification.
```

Then the orchestrator schedules a one-shot CronCreate for the expected
duration (e.g., 4 minutes after merge for a typical Cloud Build) to verify:

```python
CronCreate(
  cron="<one-shot expression for now+4min>",
  prompt="Verify auto-deploy for PR #N: gh run view <run-id>; gcloud run revisions list ...",
  recurring=False
)
```

**Option 2 — Subagent uses `gh pr checks --watch` (single blocking call):**

```
8. `gh pr checks <PR#> --watch` — this blocks until CI conclusion (single
   tool call, no polling loop).
9. If green, merge.
```

`gh pr checks --watch` is a single blocking subprocess that doesn't return
until CI completes. The subagent makes ONE tool call and waits inside that
call. The harness sees one long-running tool, not dozens of short ones.

### Reactive (you already see the polling pattern)

If a subagent is already in a zero-tool-use polling loop:

1. **Don't tell the agent to keep waiting** — every "ack, keep going"
   reply costs more than just taking over.
2. **Take over via CronCreate**: schedule a one-shot verification fire-time
   based on remaining expected duration, with a self-contained verification
   prompt.
3. **Let the agent's polling timeout naturally**. Don't kill it (TaskStop
   would also burn a turn) — just stop responding to its notifications.
   The orchestrator's verification cron will do the actual close-out.

### Tactical scripts

For the common Cloud-Run-via-GHA-`pull_request:closed` deploy verification:

```bash
# Verify auto-deploy completed for a merged PR.
# Run this from a one-shot CronCreate ~4 min after merge.
PR_NUMBER=$1
REPO=$2
SERVICE=$3
REGION=${4:-us-central1}

# Find the workflow run by name (NOT by squash SHA — that's a different SHA
# than the synthesized merge ref the workflow ran on)
RUN_ID=$(gh run list --repo "$REPO" \
  --workflow "Auto-deploy pulse on PR merge" \
  --limit 5 --json databaseId,status,createdAt \
  --jq '[.[] | select(.status != "skipped")][0].databaseId')

# Check workflow conclusion
gh run view "$RUN_ID" --repo "$REPO" --json status,conclusion

# Confirm new revision is active
gcloud run revisions list --service "$SERVICE" --region "$REGION" \
  --limit 3 --format='table(name,active,createTime)'
```

## Verification

After applying takeover:

- Subagent's polling notifications stop arriving at the orchestrator (it
  either terminates on a timeout or you've stopped responding)
- Cron-scheduled verification fires once, runs ~5-10 tool calls, declares
  done, exits — orchestrator spends ONE turn instead of N
- Total orchestrator turns spent on the wait: 1 (fire-and-forget cron
  schedule) + 1 (cron fires + orchestrator handles result) = 2

Compare to without takeover: 10-20 turns × N notifications.

## Example

an earlier session Track C orchestration (2026-05-08):

- Dispatched Track C subagent with brief that included "9. Verify
  auto-deploy: poll GHA workflow + `gcloud run revisions list`"
- Subagent merged PR #570 at 17:12:46 UTC
- Subagent then went into polling loop — by 17:14 had sent 8+ zero-tool-use
  `<task-notification>` events to orchestrator: "Still running.",
  "Continuing to wait.", "Auto-deploy still in progress.", etc.
- Each notification cost ~one orchestrator turn (~hundreds of tokens of
  context plus the response)
- **Recovery**: orchestrator scheduled a one-shot `CronCreate` at +4min
  (`17 18 8 5 *`) with a self-contained verify prompt, then stopped
  responding to subagent notifications. The cron fired once at 18:17,
  did `gh run view 25569007030` + `gcloud run revisions list`, confirmed
  revision `00048-jds` active, posted final summary, exited.
- Net savings: ~10 orchestrator turns avoided

The subagent's ~10 zero-tool-use micro-cycles cost the subagent itself
~1KB of context — negligible. The orchestrator-side cost was the real bug.

## Notes

- The takeover pattern has a sister case for **scheduled multi-track
  workflows** (RemoteTrigger + cron-fired orchestrator): that's covered
  by `schedule-poll-orchestrator-pattern`. This skill is the in-session
  single-subagent variant.
- `gh pr checks --watch` is a much underused alternative to polling loops.
  When the subagent's wait is on CI specifically (not deploy), prefer the
  single-blocking-call form.
- Some external events have webhooks / `WORKFLOW_RUN` notifications you
  could subscribe to instead of polling, but in-session orchestrator
  context can't easily receive those — cron-based fire-time approximation
  is usually the practical answer.
- The Anthropic prompt cache TTL is 5 minutes. If your one-shot cron is
  scheduled for 4 minutes out, the orchestrator's reactivation reads cache;
  past 5 min, it pays a cache miss. Tradeoff: shorter wait = stays cached
  but might fire too early and need re-schedule; longer wait = cache miss
  but more reliable single-fire. For Cloud Build typical 3-5 min, schedule
  at +4min, accept occasional re-schedule.
- This skill applies to ANY external-event wait, not just deploy: long
  pytest suite, Dataform compile, BigQuery long-running query, baker
  invocation polling, model training job completion, etc.
